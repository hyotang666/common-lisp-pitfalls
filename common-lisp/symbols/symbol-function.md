# Difficult to understand.

`SYMBOL-FUNCTION` may not return function.

[The specification says](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_1.htm)

> If the symbol is globally defined as a macro or a special operator, an object of implementation-dependent nature and identity is returned.
